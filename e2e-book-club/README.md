# BookClub Service API tests project

> Generated automatically by **e2efast**.

## Overview

This project was scaffolded from the OpenAPI specification for the `book_club` service. The codebase is organised to keep generated artefacts separate from the places where you add custom logic, making it safe to rerun the generator whenever the contract changes.

## Quick Start

1. Run the generator (adjusting service name/spec as needed). The `--spec`
   option accepts either a local file path or an HTTP(S) URL:

   ```bash
   poetry run e2efast book_club --spec ./openapi.json --with-tests
   ```

2. Open `framework/settings/base_settings.py` and provide host values for the
   generated fields. The generator will append new services to this file
   automatically—you only need to fill in the URLs.

3. Environment variables are optional: leave them unset if you rely on
   `Settings()` defaults, or export overrides before running tests:

   ```bash
   export BOOK_CLUB_BASE_URL="https://api.example.test"
   ```

   Generated clients, fixtures, and tests will read values from `Settings()` on
   every run.

4. Need only clients and fixtures (without tests)? Run the same command with
   `--with-fixtures` (the `--spec` option still accepts a path or URL):

   ```bash
   poetry run e2efast book_club --spec ./openapi.json --with-fixtures
   ```

```
* **internal** – contains the raw clients and data models produced by `restcodegen`. These files are overwritten on each generation. If you need a technical helper (e.g. custom HTTP adapter or DB-aware client), place it in another module to avoid losing changes.
* **framework/clients/http/book_club** – hosts subclasses of the generated clients. Override methods here to simplify calls or add project-specific behaviour. Files in this folder are **not** overwritten after the first generation.
* **framework/fixtures/http/book_club.py** – pytest fixtures that instantiate the wrapper clients. They provide a single entry point for the HTTP client configuration used inside tests.

## Using the Fixtures

1. Fixtures are auto-registered via `tests/conftest.py` by calling
   `get_fixtures()`. If you add custom fixture modules, extend the returned list
   or append to `pytest_plugins` in that file.

2. Provide base URLs in either `framework/settings/base_settings.py` or via
   environment variables. The settings generator keeps the file in sync with new
   services, so you typically only update the values:

   ```bash
   export BOOK_CLUB_BASE_URL="https://api.example.test"
   ```

3. If you need to change the HTTP client implementation globally, edit
   `framework/fixtures/http/base.py` and update `ClientClass`. Every generated
   fixture imports that alias and will pick up the override automatically.

4. `framework/settings/base_settings.py` is editable and now auto-augmented on
   subsequent generations. New services get appended as `str | None` fields, so
   you only need to supply the URL. Environment variable names follow the pattern
   `<package_name_upper>_BASE_URL` and are mirrored in the settings aliases.

## Regeneration Guidelines

- Re-run `e2efast` each time the OpenAPI specification changes. The generator will refresh `internal/` and fixture code while leaving your custom wrappers untouched.
- Keep custom business logic inside the `clients/http/book_club` package or other user-created modules.
- If you introduce additional fixtures, remember to register their module path in `pytest_plugins` as well.
